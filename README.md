## 📖 Project Description  

The **Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm** is designed to automate repetitive tasks using hand gestures. The robotic arm consists of **four links**: a **base, two links, and an end effector**, enabling **pick-and-place functionality**.  

Control is achieved via a **glove-based gesture system**, equipped with **flex sensors and an accelerometer**, translating hand movements into precise robotic commands.

## ✨ Features  

🤖 4-Link Robotic Arm Structure
    ➤ Enables precise and flexible movement

🖐️ Gesture-Based Control
    ➤ Uses flex sensors and an accelerometer for intuitive interaction

📦 Pick-and-Place Functionality
    ➤ Automates repetitive tasks with ease

🧭 Intuitive User Interface
    ➤ Offers seamless and user-friendly control 

> **Note:**  
> The integration of a 4th link between the end effector and the robotic arm is part of our planned system expansion.  
> In the current release, the design has been optimized for stability, ease of control, and project timelines.  
> Full 4-link integration, offering enhanced dexterity and extended functionality, is scheduled for future updates.  
> Further design considerations and future rollout details are outlined in the [DESIGN.MD](./designs/DESIGN.MD) file.

## ⚙️ Installation Instructions  

- 🛠️ For installation instructions and to download the Arduino IDE, visit the [Arduino IDE Download Page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- Add the ESP32 Library to the ide [Instructions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html)
- To set up the project, follow these steps: 
- Clone the repository:
- ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Robo-Linkers/Gesture-controlled-robotic-arm.git 
  ```
- Install any necessary dependencies [REQUIREMENTS](requirements.txt)
- Navigate to the project directory:
- ```cd Gesture-controlled-robotic-arm```
- In the `src` folder, you will find two Arduino code files: `Glove.ino` and `Power_Drive.ino`.
  - Upload `Glove.ino` to the ESP32 board that handles gesture recognition.
  - Upload `Power_Drive.ino` to the ESP32 board that controls the robotic arm's movements.
- Before uploading the codes to the boards, make sure to:
  - Edit the relevant fields in both files:
    - Set your WiFi SSID and Password in the code.  
    - Adjust any other parameters as necessary for your setup (e.g., GPIO pins, motor controls).

Once you've uploaded both codes to the respective boards, your setup should be ready for further testing.
- For building the hardware and assembling the robotic arm, refer to the detailed setup and wiring instructions in the [DESIGN.MD](./designs/DESIGN.MD) file. This includes schematics, PCB & hardware designs, and wiring connections necessary to physically construct the system.
-  All Markdown files are available as HTML in the [docs/](./docs) section — check it out for easy browsing and reference.

## 🚀 Usage Instructions  
- After setting up the hardware and software, wear the glove equipped with sensors, power on the robotic arm, and start performing gestures to control its movements.
  ### Components
  - Robotic Arm: 4-link structure with servos.
  - Glove Interface: Equipped with flex sensors and an accelerometer
  - Microcontroller: ESP32 or compatible board for processing input signals
  - Power Supply: AC power source for operation.
  ### Designs
  - For detailed information on the setup, schematics, and design documents related to the glove and robotic arm, refer to the Design Folder. It includes all the necessary diagrams and documentation to help you build the physical system and understand the circuitry.
  ### Testing
  - The tests folder contains Arduino sketches for testing individual components, including:
    - Flex sensors
    - Dual MPU6050
    - Power electronics (motors, servos)
  - If you encounter any errors, test each component individually to identify the source of the issue. 
  > It is **highly recommended** to test each component individually before full assembly to ensure everything is working correctly and to avoid complications during the final integration.
